					<p>The sport of Color Guard has its roots in centuries-old military practices.  In ancient times, armies would march into battle carrying their flags. In the Civil War, when armies wanted bands to accompany them into battle, they also had members carry flags into battle. Over time Color Gaurd became associated with marching bands, and eventually began to perform with the band. The art of color guard slowly evolved over years to become what it is today. In addition to performing with marching band, there is another branch of color guard called winter guard that performs without a marching band. Winter guard performs indoors at comptitions and can perform to any music, not just music played by a marching band.</p>
